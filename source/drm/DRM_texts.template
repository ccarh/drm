Website: [http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/list/ Deutsches Textarchiv  (German Text Archive)]

This carefully executed project aims to put the classic printed literature in German online. Its holdings are far better curated than the same titles in Google Books and other aggregation gateways.  Optically recognized text is shown side-by-side with the original image.  Books are categorized by century (according to date of publication).  Contains dramas ([http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe Goethe]), treatises ([http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx Karl Marx]), autobiographies ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck Otto von Bismark]), lyrics ([http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barthold_Heinrich_Brockes Brockes], [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Gottlieb_Klopstock Klopstock]), novels ([http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Paul Jean Paul]), legal writings, local history, travel literature, theology, satire, and a long list of short-run early newspapers.  DTA holdings are [http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml TEI]-complaint.  The great strengths of the DTA include its internal search, its [http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/view/trichter_ritterexercitienlexikon_1742/?hl=Matthe%C5%BFon&amp;p=158 side-by-side view of original and recognized text], and its tiered metadata structures.
