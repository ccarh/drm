====Ludwig van Beethoven: Beethoven-Haus, Bonn====

Website: [http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php?template=startseite_digitales_archiv_de Beethoven Haus, Bonn]

The digital archive at the Beethoven-Haus, Bonn, contains manuscripts, sketches, letters, pictures, sample sound recordings, and much else.  Beethoven lived here, and the physical museum also houses his instrument collection.  A recently funded project involving the Beethoven-Haus and the Musikhochschule in Detmold will develop an ambitious "[http://muwi-detmold-paderborn.de/aktuelles/einzelnews/article/beethovens-werkstatt.html Beethoven Werkstaat]" project taking viewers through the development of individual works by way of sketches and editions.

====Beethovens Werkstatt (Beethoven's Workshop)====

[[File:BW_FedRovelli-BernhardApel.png|350px|thumb|right|&lt;small>Federica Rovelli and Bernhard Apel examine a digitized Beethoven sketch at the Beethoven-Haus on Nov. 30, 2014.

The ambitious &lt;i>Beethovens Werkstatt&lt;/i> project, officially launched in 2014, will between now and 2030 reconstruct (with images and critical notes) the path of development of Beethoven's works from inception to completion.  This project is based on the composer's sketch books, which in the digital version are to be carefully annotated with the help of [http://music-encoding.org/home MEI] (the Music Encoding Initiative), a markup language for the encoding of musical sources facilitating their citation in critical editions.  Bernhard Apel (Beethoven-Haus, Bonn) and Joachim Veit (Musikwissenschaftliches Institut, Detmold/Padlerborn) are the project directors. Johannes Kepper ([http://muwi-detmold-paderborn.de/unser-team/kepper.html Edirom project]) is centrally involved in the technical development of both &lt;i>Werkstatt&lt;/i> and MEI.  The link above shows a prototype browser for viewing both manuscript iterations and modern notation for variants in the first movement of Beethoven's C-Minor Piano Sonata Op. 111 in Variants 14–17 (Beethoven-Haus BH 71).

Shortly before his death [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Grieg Edvard Grieg] (1843-1907) arranged for the donation of all his music, letters, and related materials to the Bergen Public Library. The origins of the digitization project date back to 1993, the 150th anniversary of Grieg's birth. Grieg had a deep interest in recording technologies of his time.  Starting in 1903 he made nine recordings of his music (on 78s), player-piano rolls from live-performance ([https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Hupfeld_AG Ludwig Hupfeld]'s  Phonola and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welte-Mignon Welte-Mignon]), and the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_Company Aeolian Company].

====e-codices: Virtual Manuscript Library of Switzerland====

Website: [http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en &lt;i>e-codices&lt;/i>] 

[[File:Marchettus-f10r.jpg|300px|thumb|left|&lt;small>Marchettus of Padua: "Tractatus musice speculative", f. 10r, from Einsiedeln Cod. 689(1200), f. 10r&lt;/small>.]]

In many ways &lt;i>e-codices&lt;/i>, the Virtual Manuscript Library of Switzerland, is an unsurpassed example of maximal access to fundamental but rarely seen sources.  Currently serving almost 1,400 parchments and manuscripts, its online existence began in 2007.  Its value to musicology owes partly to a tight coupling between early histories of music and the sources on which these accounts were often based.  The digital apparatus is very clearly articulated, and it search by many rubrics is possible.  Access to color images of the materials long known only from running-text summaries of them enables users to pose new questions of interpretation.  Users can construct new juxtapositions and concatenations of source details in relationships that could not previously be explored.  An [http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/info/annotation_tool annotation tool] enables users to highlight pertinent findings.  &lt;i>e-codices&lt;/i> is based on like-named software, which holds the distinction of running equally well on mobile and non-mobile platforms.  An author list is available [http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/all/authors here]. 

Among its many riches to be found are these rare items:

* [http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/list/all/title/pnd_118707566 Writings of Hucbaldus] (840-930) from the Benedictine abbey at Einsiedeln.

Among its 221 music manuscripts posted online, the Juilliard School possesses many unexpected items and substantial coverage of twentieth-century British and American composers (Samuel Barber, Frank Bridge) and many European composers whose music was popular in the US.   Other collections represented at Juilliard include the collections of pianist [http://www.arthurrubinsteinmusiccollection.org/ Arthur Rubinstein] and the popular composer of musicals [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Willson Meredith Wilson] (1902–1984).

====Music Gifts for the Russian Emperors==== 

Website: [http://expositions.nlr.ru/MusicalManuscripts/eng/project.php Music Gifts for the Russian Emperors]

The National Library of Russia has made available this carefully curated collection of music given to Romanov emperors by visitors from France, Italy, Germany, and elsewhere.  Many holdings come from Russia, where Western European music was introduced early in the eighteenth century. Holdings come from the 18th-20th centuries.  Some of the music was brought by foreign teachers (e.g., [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Manfredini Vincenzo Manfredini]) for the royal progeny.  Many works were provided with dedications to the emperors.  Czech and Austrian music flowed copiously into Moscow at the end of the eighteenth century.  A "Festival Song" by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn  Felix Mendelssohn] has a particularly interesting history, which is related [http://expositions.nlr.ru/MusicalManuscripts/eng/mus_composer.php here].  The digitized pieces are linked to a database containing information about the social context and pertinent musical detail.  The list of manuscripts (using Cyrillic script) can be found [http://expositions.nlr.ru/MusicalManuscripts/_Project/page_Manuscripts?lang=en here], while a search engine (Roman script) is [http://expositions.nlr.ru/MusicalManuscripts/_Project/page_Manuscripts.php?find=1 here].

The "library of St. Mark" (i.e. the Biblioteca Nazionale "Marciana" in Venice) holds acquisitions that have been accumulating since the sixteenth century.  Following guidelines widely shared across music libraries in Italy, it has digitized music manuscripts that are most closely tied to Venice's musical history.  These include many important sources for seventeenth-century Venetian opera (Francesco Cavalli, Domenico Freschi, Giovanni Legrenzi, Carlo Pallavicino, P.A. and M.A. Ziani, and many others); 66 volumes containing cantatas of the eighteenth century by Benedetto Marcello (445 titles) and his nemesis Antonio Lotti, minuets by Baldassare Galuppi, and all the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti (357 titles; his familiarity with Venice was minimal).  Operas can be accessed by act.

Website: [http://hofmusik.slub-dresden.de/ Court Music in Dresden]
