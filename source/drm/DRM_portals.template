===&lt;i>Europeana&lt;/i>: Search Engine for European (Music) Sources===

Website: [http://www.europeana.eu Europeana]

This umbrella site for European digitization projects covers a great deal besides music.  To start, limit the search by an obvious word for music (&lt;i>musique&lt;/i>, &lt;i>musica&lt;/i>, &lt;i>Musik&lt;/i>, etc.).  This will give you an idea of how to further limit the search. Europeana is updated often.  Among the items that should be visible are music prints, manuscripts, newspapers dedicated to music, sheet-music, audio files, etc.  Since Europeana is an aggregation, it provides links back to the sponsoring libraries that hold the original sources.  The site can be searched in many languages.

===Gallica===

Website: [http://gallica.bnf.fr Gallica]

&lt;i>Gallica&lt;/i> provides access to an enormous array of digitized materials from all periods of French history and many aspects of French musical life in addition to great quantities of non-musical material.  Among its highlights are  illuminated manuscripts containing the poetry (much of it set to music by Guillaume Machaut), manuscripts of the operas Francesco Cavalli composed for the wedding of Louis XIV (1660-62), a very large amount of music printed in France in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and important documentation for theatrical history.

An umbrella site for digitized materials in Italian libraries.  The riches of Italy's collective Internet Culturale (cultural internet) are difficult to overstate.  A vast span of different kinds of graphically reproduced material will be found here.  All of it is accompanied by generous supplies of metadata from cataloguing records.  While one may be able to find a specific item such as an opera, one may also discover on a different spoke a list of all the works in which the singer of an aria appeared.  Users can create accounts to collect previous discoveries in one place.

===RISM Music Manuscript Inventory===

Website: [https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism&amp;Language=en RISM Music Manuscript Inventory]

This inventory of musical manuscripts in roughly 60 countries was begun in 1952. It is still growing (under the management of the Répertoire International des Sources Musicales). Coordinated cataloging in based at the RISM Zantralredaktion in Frankfurt, database management and processing at the Berlin State Library, and online implementation at the Bavarian State Library, Munich. RISM's numerous merits are easily discovered through in use. A RISM [http://www.rism.info/ blog] keeps registered users informed of current activities. RISM has working groups on [http://www.rism.info/en/international.html most continents]. Much material currently contained in [http://www.rism.info/en/publications.html RISM books] will (with updating) find its way online over the coming years. Those interested in contributing to RISM's efforts may contact a local representative by looking [http://www.rism.info/en/international/working-group-overview.html here]. Other RISM cataloguing projects are in transition to online presentations.  One of them (A1: &lt;i>Printed anthologies of music before 1800&lt;/i>) are now integrated in the RISM OPAC (online catalogue sited above). Several country-specific websites sited below offer alternative organizations and search tools for holdings. Some also include related  materials or an expanded date range. 

====RISM France (RISM FR)====

Website: [http://neuma.huma-num.fr/corpus/rism RISM France (RISM FR)

RISM France, under the direction of Laurence Decobert, is currently cataloguing music manuscripts up to 1800 in the Bibiliothèque Nationale de France.  Holdings are particularly rich in works by Joseph and Michael Haydn, Chr. W. Gluck, Fr-J. Gossec, and J-Ph. Rameau. At present close to 1,350 manuscripts have been entered. Entries have links to several formats including MIDI files (and displays) of musical incipits.

====RISM Ireland (RISM IE)====

Website: [http://www.rism-ie.org/ RISM Ireland (RISM IE)

The Society of Musicology in Ireland (Eire) is the sponsor of this cataloging initiative. Its search tools are modeled on those of the UK site. At present works by 265 composers are represented. Associated collections with listings in progress include [http://www.rism-ie.org/pages/countryhouses Music in the Irish Country House] and [http://www.rism-ie.org/pages/nationallibrary Music in the National Library of Ireland].

====RISM Switzerland (RISM CH)====

Website: [http://www.rism-ch.org RISM Switzerland]

Early Music Online]; an impressive [https://picasaweb.google.com/musicmss?fgl=true&amp;pli=1 image gallery], useful for quick comparison of handwriting and paper; a lookup table for [http://www.rism.org.uk/places places of publication]; and useful [http://www.rism.org.uk/manuscripts?strategy=index collection-level clusters] of indexing.  UK manuscripts were the earliest sources to be catalogued by RISM, and the depth of information reflects almost 50 years of accrual.

===&lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i>: Music-Incipit Search===

Website: [http://www.themefinder.org Themefinder]

[[File:TF-png.PNG|300px|thumb|right|&lt;small>Music-search categories in [http://www.themefinder.org Themefinder]&lt;/small>.]]

The &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> search engine was prototyped at CCARH in 1996 by David Huron, Andreas Kornstädt, and Walter B. Hewlett.  A large number of Stanford University students including Unjung Kim and Leigh VanHandel plus visiting students including Bret Aarden participated in its early development.  The search engine was originally developed to study user behavior.  Over the intervening years it has been used for a large statistical study of search-efficiency.  The current search engine was built and is maintained by Craig Stuart Sapp.  

&lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> contains several repertories, most of which are publicly viewable and searchable. The principal repertories are Folk, Classical, and Renaissance.  Although more than 100,000 incipits and associated metadata are present in the database, users may select just one.  "Hits" satisfying search-criteria can be collected on the &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> Clipboard and can be exported.  

Incipits can be searched at five points on a continuing from the most specific to the fuzziest.  Filter for meter, mode, and key may be used.  MIDI files are available for each entry. Help menus are available at the website.  Those interested in contributing an encoded repertory to &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> should describe the existing repertory and format in a query letter.
