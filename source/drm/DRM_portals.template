The  Musiconn Score Search is the latest in a series of note-search engines. It attempts to search manuscript and printed sources included in the ViFaMusik website.  It is a very ambitious project, but the search mechanisms are works in progress. It currently (9/22) lacks enharmonic discrimination and does not anchor searches to any bar or voice. Some of the notation displayed is confused by ledger lines.  When it works correctly, it may link the user to an exact location in an old print, which, because it is out-of-copyright, may be downloaded.

Website: [http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg/index.html Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts]

This project of the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies at the University of Pennsylvania is for medieval studies what RISM is for music studies: It provides a comprehensive inventory of manuscripts up to the year 1600.  Listings can currently be focused on any of 26 categories of description including date, place, language, library, provenance, liturgical use, vendor, artist, and many physical descriptors.  Within each category searches can be narrowed by the same and similar terms. Although many of the items of musical relevance listed here may appear in [https://www.diamm.ac.uk/about/ DIAMM] and other inventories, much of the information appears to be complementary. Although no links to digitized sources are given, the database has the inherent value of providing a rapid impression of the prevalence and/or spread of certain kinds of materials. As one example, almost 15,000 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours Books of Hours] are listed.

* The searchable [http://liber.simssa.ca/ &lt;i>Liber Usualis&lt;/i>], based on optical recognition of both text and music, is an invaluable reference in defining the chants appropriate to the specific feasts that define the liturgical year.  Many of these chants were used pervasively in polyphonic compositions of the Renaissance, but identifying chants can be difficult.    

* ELVIS: Electronic Locator of Vertical Interval Successions grows out of contrapuntal theories of the Renaissance, in which vertical sonorities (Vertical Interval Successions, or VIZ) between adjacent voices were emphasized.  The VIZ component is a Python package that uses the music21 and pandas libraries to build a flexible and system for writing music-analysis programs.  It operates on a [http://database.elvisproject.ca database] of pieces that extend well beyond the Renaissance. The search-form [http://counterpoint.elvisproject.ca/ prototype] allows users to check off features of the intended analysis.

The &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> search engine was prototyped at CCARH in 1996 by David Huron, Andreas Kornstädt, and Walter B. Hewlett.  A large number of Stanford University students including Unjung Kim and Leigh VanHandel plus visiting students including Bret Aarden participated in its early development.  The search engine was originally developed to study user behavior.  Over the intervening years it has been used for a large statistical study of search-efficiency.  The current search engine was built and is maintained by Craig Stuart Sapp.  

&lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> contains several repertories, most of which are publicly viewable and searchable. The principal repertories are Folk, Classical, and Renaissance.  Although more than 100,000 incipits and associated metadata are present in the database, users may select just one.  "Hits" satisfying search-criteria can be collected on the &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> Clipboard and can be exported.  

Incipits can be searched at five points on a continuing from the most specific to the fuzziest.  Filter for meter, mode, and key may be used.  MIDI files are available for each entry. Help menus are available at the website.  Those interested in contributing an encoded repertory to &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> should describe the existing repertory and format in a query letter.
