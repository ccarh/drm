=== Musiconn Score Search === 

Website: https://https://scoresearch.musiconn.de/ScoreSearch

The  Musiconn Score Search is the latest in a series of note-search engines. It attempts to search manuscript and printed sources included in the ViFaMusik website.  It is a very ambitious project, but the search mechanisms are works in progress. It currently (9/22) lacks enharmonic discrimination and does not anchor searches to any bar or voice. Some of the notation displayed is confused by ledger lines.  When it works correctly, it may link the user to an exact location in an old print, which, because it is out-of-copyright, may be downloaded.



=== Musiekschatten (Music Treasures) === 

Website: https://www.muziekschatten.nl

This archive of Netherlands Radio sheet music (Hilversum NL) contains nearly 450,000 scores of classical, light, and popular music (including manuscripts) played on Dutch radio and television since the 1920's.

Now in its eighth decade, a major overhaul in 2022 offers a new working paradigm. Recent efforts have also focused on linking textual and musical content in searches. Additional details can be found in a dedicated issue of [https://rism.info/new_publications/2022/11/10/fontes-special-issue-in-celebration-of-risms-seventieth-anniversary.html &lt;i>Fontes Artis Musicae&lt;/i>].  Search interfaces are offered in English, French, and German.      

&lt;h4> RISM user resources &lt;/h4>

RISM has these search tools:

* [https://rism.info RISM Info] gives news announcements and a central portal to pursue organizational information. Many important announcements of source discoveries have appeared here in recent years.  
* [https://opac.rism.info RISM OPAC] is the online catalogue for musical incipits from printed and manuscript sources. It now offers a combined catalogue based on dozens of  separate national projects. In July 2023 it included citations to almost 1,500,000 musical sources. Several [https://opac.rism.info/main-menu-/kachelmenu/help help guides] are available.
* [https://rism.online/about RISM Online] enables word searches across all RISM properties including musical-incipit searches.  Searches can be confined to holdings of one country.  Word searches are useful for finding individual contributions to pastiches and other hand-to-classify works.  RISM Online also reports

&lt;h4> RISM Operations &lt;/h4>

RISM now has multiple administrative structures.  

* RISM Info has branches for [https://rism.info/community/muscat.html MUSCAT], the course-based catalogue, and [https://rism.info/working-groups.html working groups]. MUSCAT is responsible for coordinating information of different kinds and from different national collections. Substantial contributions from France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom formed the original core of the database. Roughly half of sources anticipated in the complete inventory are currently available for online access. Working groups, currently operating in 35 countries, identify and catalogue sources. Those interested in contributing to RISM's efforts may contact a local representative by looking [http://www.rism.info/en/international/working-group-overview.html here].  Some working-group catalogues can still be found online.  
* The [https://rism.info/editorial-center.html RISM Editorial Center], or Zentralredaktion, in Frankfurt supports editorial groups and provides help with enabling software.
* The [https://rism.digital/ RISM Digital Center], established in 2021 in Bern, manages the development of MUSCAT and interfaces with servers in Berlin and Munich. The digital center, which is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, also develops and maintains Verovio, an open-source MEI score renderer as well as interfaces to other digital musical score formats such as [https://verovio.humdrum.org Humdrum]

&lt;h4> RISM Musical Incipit Search and Online Digital Score Links &lt;/h4>

Website: [https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism&amp;SearchType=2&amp;Language=en RISM Advanced Incipit Search]

Two of the most often used features of the RISM catalogue are its musical-incipit search tool (at the Advanced link shown above) and its link to manuscript scores digitized by holding libraries. Most of the online-source links come from sources in such places as Dresden and Berlin, with many more locations awaiting catalogue links. When it comes to finding sources of uncertain authorship, the incipit search has proved its worth many times over.  

The incipit search tool, with its sliders for fuzzy searches, was modeled on the [https://www.themefinder.org Themefinder] search developed at [https://wiki.ccarh.org CCARH] in 1996–1999 by David Huron, Craig Sapp, and Andreas Kornstaedt. Laurent Pugin instituted to slider interface, and the graphical keyboard was introduced by the Munich RISM office. The integrated whole was implemented in MUSCAT in 2010, then subject to numerous tests, comparisons, and revisions.

Website: http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/schoenberg/index.html

This project of the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies at the University of Pennsylvania is for medieval studies what RISM is for music studies: It provides a comprehensive inventory of manuscripts up to the year 1600.  Listings can currently be focused on any of 26 categories of description including date, place, language, library, provenance, liturgical use, vendor, artist, and many physical descriptors.  Within each category searches can be narrowed by the same and similar terms. Although many of the items of musical relevance listed here may appear in [https://www.diamm.ac.uk/about/ DIAMM] and other inventories, much of the information appears to be complementary. Although no links to digitized sources are given, the database has the inherent value of providing a rapid impression of the prevalence and/or spread of certain kinds of materials. As one example, almost 15,000 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_hours Books of Hours] are listed. The advanced search feature is elegantly articulated to support with myriad text and numeric search combinations.  The beta version has been online since August 2016. Periodic uploads are planned.



=== SIMSSA === 

Website: https://simssa.ca

The Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis project (SIMSSA), based at McGill University, is teaching computers to recognize the musical symbols in digital images of musical scores. Scans of music prints and manuscripts are processed, and their contents (both text and music) are entered into a searchable format that can be studied, analyzed, and performed. Projects include:

* [http://cantus.simssa.ca &lt;i>Cantus Ultimus&lt;/i>] shares with other McGill music projects a reliance on optical recognition of both text and music. Otherwise it builds on the digital infrastructure of the existing [http://cantus.uwaterloo.ca/ CANTUS database} one of the oldest and most important scholarly music databases in the world.  It is also part of Cantus Index network (see under Databases).  The title Cantus Ultimus signifies the amalgamation of tools and data a research environment in which manuscript music and text are fully searchable.  At present the manuscript browsing interface enables searches by neume names, pitch names, and text within select prototype manuscripts.
* The searchable [http://liber.simssa.ca/ &lt;i>Liber Usualis&lt;/i>], based on optical recognition of both text and music, is an invaluable reference in defining the chants appropriate to the specific feasts that define the liturgical year.  Many of these chants were used pervasively in polyphonic compositions of the Renaissance, but identifying chants can be difficult.    
* ELVIS: Electronic Locator of Vertical Interval Successions grows out of contrapuntal theories of the Renaissance, in which vertical sonorities (Vertical Interval Successions, or VIZ) between adjacent voices were emphasized.  The VIZ component is a Python package that uses the music21 and pandas libraries to build a flexible and system for writing music-analysis programs.  It operates on a [http://database.elvisproject.ca database] of pieces that extend well beyond the Renaissance. The search-form [http://counterpoint.elvisproject.ca/ prototype] allows users to check off features of the intended analysis.



=== Song Helix (repertory search) === 

Website: https://www.songhelix.com

&lt;i>Song Helix&lt;/i> is a comprehensive art song database site for researching for vocal repertory (a) for a specific voice and (b) in as many manifestations as can be found online.  These include scores, lyrics, digitized images, poetic themes, and audio renditions, accompanied by various metadata fields such as vocal range, original key, original language, and the contributing entity.  &lt;i>Caveat lector&lt;/i>: citations may lead to public-domain or  commercial sources.

=== &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i>: Music-Incipit Search === 

Website: http://www.themefinder.org

[[File:TF-png.PNG|300px|thumb|right|&lt;small>Music-search categories in [http://www.themefinder.org Themefinder]&lt;/small>.]]

The &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> search engine was prototyped at CCARH in 1996 by David Huron, Andreas Kornstädt, and Walter B. Hewlett.  A large number of Stanford University students including Unjung Kim and Leigh VanHandel plus visiting students including Bret Aarden participated in its early development.  The search engine was originally developed to study user behavior.  Over the intervening years it has been used for a large statistical study of search-efficiency.  The current search engine was built and is maintained by Craig Stuart Sapp.  

&lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> contains several repertories, most of which are publicly viewable and searchable. The principal repertories are Folk, Classical, and Renaissance.  Although more than 100,000 incipits and associated metadata are present in the database, users may select just one.  "Hits" satisfying search-criteria can be collected on the &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> Clipboard and can be exported.  

Incipits can be searched at five points on a continuing from the most specific to the fuzziest.  Filter for meter, mode, and key may be used.  MIDI files are available for each entry. Help menus are available at the website.  Those interested in contributing an encoded repertory to &lt;i>Themefinder&lt;/i> should describe the existing repertory and format in a query letter.

=== Vocal Music Instrumentation Index (VMII) === 

Website: https://www.vmii.org

Performers often wish they could easily locate selections featuring their chosen instrument.The information is elusive. Multimovement works usually have summary descriptions. Although the content here is textual only, performers can quickly locate appropriate repertory at the single-movement level.  Currently more than 12,500 listings are included, with headings for specific instruments, composers, etc. Teachers and historians will also find this index to be very helpful.  The European Early Music Network awarded this site its New Technology Prize.
