Databases containing material of value to musicologists have been in creation for more than 30 years.  While most are focused on a single subject, methods of structuring are variable. Sites in which the material is predominantly textual are listed here.  Text and image are integrated on some sites.  Sites that focus on images with only sparse metadata are listed above. Among subjects listed here here: catalogues, inventories, and thematic indices; letters and treatises; instrument makers; ethnomusicological sources; and image archives.

=====T&lt;big>he Clarinet Quintet&lt;/big>=====

Website: [http://clarinetquintet.web.unc.edu/ The Clarinet Quintet]

This online catalog is a continuing project to bring together all repertoire that exists for the clarinet quintet (defined as a string quartet plus a clarinet). The project seeks to offer complete, authoritative data relative to each composition and to demonstrate the totality of the genre. To that end, the site allows for, and welcomes, comments, verifiable corrections, and appropriate ancillary information that may help illuminate a better understanding of an individual work or the entirety of the repertoire.

This online catalog evolved from the personal catalog of Donald L. Oehler.  Currently containing 600 works, it was developed over decades of a professional career. The project will continue to grow as works are regularly entered not only from Oehler's collected catalog listings but from the most recent and reliable data available for new works or newly discovered works. Currently (2015) the online catalog is approaching 400 entries." Each entry shows a facsimile of the first page and gives title concordances and other information about the work. The site's search boxes enables random access. Works can be grouped by period, country of origin, and key. 

=====&lt;big>Classical String Quartets&lt;/big>=====

Website: [http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/quartets/ Classical String Quartets]

This website may not represent the largest collection of this repertory, but it is the largest collection of digitized prints currently accessible online. Its contents are characterized as "rare and unusual" rather than mainstream. If you are looking for variety, consider Förster, Gassmann, Pixis, or Wranitsky (a small sampling of composers represented).

=====Boalch-Mould Online (BMO)=====

Website: [https://www.boalch.org/ Boalch-Mould Online: A research database of harpsichords and clavichords, 1440-1925]

The designers of this website have given much thought to matters of organization. Early keyboard instruments werenot mass-produced, and the range of differences from one to the next has been given due consideration. BMO is also unusual in accepting additions from private owners, which over time can produce a rounder picture of individual maker's achievements. The introductory video lays out the aims and organization of the material. Each instrument is assigned a BMO number to facilitate accurate citation. Among the useful details is a column giving the full range of the pitches produced (e.g. FF-f3 for the Hans Ruckers instrument in the Brussels Museum entered as BMO 111, dated &lt;i>c&lt;/i>1612). This barely scratches the surface of the detail on offer, for one can quickly find many other precise specifications (e.g. dimensions, unusual features, previous owners) and in many cases photographs.

Website: [http://www.liuteriabresciana.it/pit001.htm Brescian Instrument Makers--currently unavailable]

Brescia was the first home of violin-making.  So many of the early makers died in the plague of 1630-31 that Brescia was unable to regain its former glory. It exerted considerable influence on instrument-making in nearby Cremona, which flourished after 1650. Ugo Ravasio's former website (&lt;i>Liuteria Bresciana&lt;/i>) covered the period from 1550 into until the mid-eighteenth century. His integration of archival documents, pictures of instruments, and a searchable database filled an important hole in our knowledge of the development of bowed string instruments. The great plague of 1630-1631 halved the Brescian population and nearly destroyed the instrument trade. The revival of this website is warmly anticipated.

=====&lt;big>Historical Calendars of Europe (HCAL)&lt;/big>=====

Website: [http://hcal.ccarh.org/ Historic Calendars of Europe (HCAL)]

Those looking to reconcile modern dates with those in use before the Gregorian calendar was adopted can derive a correct translation here.  Many more calendars were in use than those indicated here.  Adoption of the Gregorian (modern Western) calendar occurred between 1582 and 1926.  Standardized tools to generate early calendars (e.g. the Unix cal tool) ignore historical change and thus render incorrect results.

=====&lt;big>Liturgical Calendars&lt;/big>=====

Many sights offer these modern calendars with various degrees of refinement, but they are not appropriate for historical use.  There can be local variations in the days of minor saints.  See such sites as [http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/ Liturgy Office] (UK); the [https://www.cpg.org/global/online-resources/liturgical-calendar/ Liturgical Calendar Online]; [http://www.goarch.org/chapel/calendar Greek Orthodox].  Some cultures maintain separate civic and religious calendars and thus impose an additional level of complexity to the reconciliation of dates.  Orthodox Jewish culture offers one example.  In simpler circumstances, the [http://www.etz-hayim.com/calendars/ Etz Hayim] website offers instructive examples on the reconciliation of Christian and Jewish dating systems.

It demarcates the beginning of the long path to access by black performers to major concert facilities south of the Mason-Dixon line.&lt;/small>]]  

The digitization of Marian Anderson's diaries and notebooks awaits crowd-sourced transcription to make its content fully searchable. It is an enticing and extensive collection that captures an important chapter of American social as well as musical history. Anderson (1897-1993) spent most of her life in Philadelphia, and the preservation of this collection (more than 2,500 items) at the University of Pennsylvania suits it well. Performers' tussles with racial barriers paralleled those of sports figures in the middle decades of the twentieth century.  The letter excerpted here documents a turning point both in Anderson's career and in what became a milestone in the Civil Rights Movements: having been prevented from appearing in Constitution Hall on Easter (April 9) in 1939, she sang on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for a crowd of 75,000.

The Musical Festivals Database (MFD) provides a searchable database of repertory programmed in British festivals between 1695 and 1940. Many items come from the choral festivals that were popular in Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The Medici Archive Project (MAP) is an ambitious effort to focus attention on the vast archives of the Medici Principiate (which endured from the early Renaissance until 1737) in the Florentine State Archives.  It is conceived as a continuing project and has spawned several quasi-independent enterprises. The online database provides short transcriptions from across the entire documentary base. The project has thus far produced more than 300,000 digitized images of records from the Medici court. Its current activities emphasize lectures and the production of videos on specific topics related to the three centuries of rule by the family.

=====&lt;big>Reid Concerts&lt;/big>=====

This database of concerts (from 1841) itemizes musical programs given at many venues in the city of Edinburgh under the auspices of the the Reid School of Music in the University of Edinburgh. By itmeizing the contents of many of all preserved concert programmes, it attempts to chart the development and evolution of the ‘Reid Concerts’. Users may investigate composer, medium, genre, venue, date, or even professor in charge to cull specific profiles. The data collection overall enables the study of changes of taste and pedagogy as well as the constellation of pieces that make up concert programs. Begun in 2013, 'Reid Concerts' is still under development. (The School of Music is now a department within Edinburgh College of Art.)

This collection abounds in the artifacts of Berlin's long life (1895-1990). From scrapbooks of press clippings to account books for the Music Box Theater and family letters to copyright assignments we see the composer of "White Christmas" and "There's No Business like Show Business" in a constant swirl of activity. Most full scores, vocal scores, and sketches were transcribed by secretaries.  Berlins' lyrics come from his own hand.  For copyright reasons most items are unavailable until 2039.

====&lt;big>Arrigo Boito Papers (Archivio Boito Digitale)&lt;/big>====

Website: [https://opac.sbn.it/ Arrigo Boito Papers (Virtual Archives)]

Arrigo Boito (1842-1918) was a composer but also a poet, novelist, and journalist who sometimes wrote under a pseudonym.  His is best known today for his librettos for Verdi's &lt;i>Otello&lt;/i> and &lt;i>Falstaff&lt;/i> plus other stage works of the time.  
The circuitous route to a coherent archive of the composer's drafts and life began with the celebration of the centenary of his death in 2018. The variety and complexity of material may be typical of the musical giants of the later nineteenth century.  A noted element of his biography was his long affair with the noted actress Eleonora Duse (1887-1894). Boito also served for eight years (1889-1897) as director of the Parma Conservatory.

What is unusual about this project is the coordination of materials in diverse physical locations to create a virtual archives through the SBN (Italian National Library) catalog.

We go from photographs with his schoolmates in a Brooklyn second grade to retreats with distinguished colleagues in the late years of his life.  Copland's essay of film music, prepared for a talk at Columbia University in 1940, which was based on his year of employment in Hollywood, offers a glimpse of the rapid pace of change in response to growing popularity of the medium.

Every repertory has idiosyncrasies that make the adoption of a standard template ill-advised.  Hugh Macdonald's &lt;i>Bizet Catalogue&lt;/i> shows one of Bizet's idiosyncrasies through a listing of the composer's transcriptions of works by others (Gounod, Mozart, Saint-Saëns, et al.).
