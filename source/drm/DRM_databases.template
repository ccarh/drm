Databases containing material of value to musicologists have been in creation for more than 30 years.  While most are focused on a single subject, methods of structuring are variable. Sites in which the material is predominantly textual are listed here.  Text and image are integrated on some sites.  Sites that focus on images with only sparse metadata are listed above. Among subjects listed here here: catalogues, inventories, and thematic indices; letters and treatises; instrument makers; ethnomusicological sources; and image archives.

Note the original neume types above the modern transcription.&lt;/small>]]

The original database, a model of integrated presentation combined with independent search of text and music fields, was developed by John Stinson and John Griffiths at LaTrobe University (Australia) between 1987 and 1999, when the university's music department was closed.  It was maintained over the next five years by the University Library and is still accessible (2014) at the above link.  Plans to bring it under the umbrella of DIAMM are under discussion.

One of MMD's great strength, for students of liturgy, is the ability to scroll bilaterally through the [http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/MMDB/Temporal.htm temporal] and [http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/MMDB/Sanctoral.htm sanctoral] cycles, that is by feasts of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_ordinary Ordinary] and those of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_(liturgy) Proper].  Other supported search fields are text, composer, genre, manuscript, and melody.  MMD is cross-referenced to the CAO database.

The musical examples in MMD were originally produced with Scribe software, also developed by Stinson and Griffiths (c. 1990).  It encoded neumes and ligatures (mainly for fourteenth-century music) for printing on a color deskjet printer.  It was designed for the DOS operating system and could export to the SCORE music-notation program.

Website: [http://www.liuteriabresciana.it/pit001.htm Brescian Instrument Makers]

Brescia was the first home of violin-making.  So many of the early makers died in the plague of 1630-31 that Brescia was unable to regain its former glory.  It exerted considerable influence on instrument-making in nearby Cremona, which flourished after 1650.  Ugo Ravasio's website (&lt;i>Liuteria Bresciana&lt;/i>), which covers the period from 1550 into until the eighteenth century, mainly emphasizes the pre-1630 period.

====Historical and Liturgical Calendars====

=====Historical Calendars of Europe (HCAL)=====

Website: [http://hcal.ccarh.org/ Historic Calendars of Europe (HCAL)]

Those looking to reconcile modern dates with those in use before the Gregorian calendar was adopted can derive a correct translation here.  Many more calendars were in use than those indicated here.  Adoption of the Gregorian (modern Western) calendar occurred between 1582 and 1926.  Standardized tools to generate early calendars (e.g. the Unix cal tool) ignore historical change and thus render incorrect results.

=====Liturgical Calendars=====

Many sights offer these modern calendars with various degrees of refinement, but they are not appropriate for historical use.  There can be local variations in the days of minor saints.  See such sites as [http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/ Liturgy Office] (UK); the [https://www.cpg.org/global/online-resources/liturgical-calendar/ Liturgical Calendar Online]; [http://www.goarch.org/chapel/calendar Greek Orthodox].  Some cultures maintain separate civic and religious calendars and thus impose an additional level of complexity to the reconciliation of dates.  Orthodox Jewish culture offers one example.  In simpler circumstances, the [http://www.etz-hayim.com/calendars/ Etz Hayim] website offers instructive examples on the reconciliation of Christian and Jewish dating systems. The [http://muslimvoices.org/islamic-calendar/ Muslim calendar] is complicated in a global context because of its dependence on (the time of) the initial visibility of a new moon, in combination of adherents across many times zones.  Additional cultures and religions, including [http://utbf.org/en/resources/calendar/ Buddhism] and [http://oca.org/fs/paschal-cycle Eastern Orthodoxy], are included in Santa Clara University's [http://www.scu.edu/cas/religiousstudies/news/calendars.cfm Calendars of the World's Religions] website.

====Other Rubrics====

=====Medici Archive Project=====

Website: [http://www.medici.org/ Medici Archive Project]

The Medici Archive Project (MAP) is an ambitious effort to focus attention on the vast archives of the Medici Principiate (which endured from the early Renaissance until 1737) in the Florentine State Archives.  It is conceived as a continuing project and has spawned several quasi-independent research projects.  The online database provides short transcriptions from across the entire documentary base.  The project has thus far produced more than 300,000 digitized images from the Medici court.

=====Reid Concerts=====

Website: [http://www.reidconcerts.music.ed.ac.uk/content/home Reid Concerts]

This database of concerts (from 1841) itemizes musical programs given at many venues in the city of Edinburgh under the auspices of the the Reid School of Music in the University of Edinburgh. By itmeizing the contents of many of all preserved concert programmes, it attempts to chart the development and evolution of the ‘Reid Concerts’. Users may investigate composer, medium, genre, venue, date, or even professor in charge to cull specific profiles. The data collection overall enables the study of changes of taste and pedagogy as well as the constellation of pieces that make up concert programs. Begun in 2013, 'Reid Concerts' is still under development. (The School of Music is now a department within Edinburgh College of Art.)

===Digitized Manuscripts and Early Printed Music===

====Danish National Digital Sheet Music Archive====

Website: [http://www.kb.dk/en/nb/samling/ma/digmus/index.html Danish National Digital Sheet Music Archive]

The Danish National Digital Sheet Music Archive is a model operation.  Note the frame at the left, which identifies all digitized music; a special collection for flute; another for guitar; and the entire Carl Nielsen Edition available for download.  Although Danish music is well served, the site includes a great deal more, including eighteenth-century manuscripts, standard repertory in high-quality late nineteenth-century prints, and a special theater collection including opera libretti.

====Early Music Online====

The collection of mainly eighteenth-century vocal music belonging to Berlin's Singakademie since the time of Karl Friedrich Zelter was long dislodged by twentieth-century wars and politics.  The institution's history is the focus of a project to digitize letters, documents, and materials on which prospective applications were tested.  The Singakademie is also a participant in the Bach Digital and other projects related to music and musical culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

===Online Thematic Catalogues and Indices===

====The Bizet Catalogue====

Every repertory has idiosyncrasies that make the adoption of a standard template ill-advised.  Hugh Macdonald's &lt;i>Bizet Catalogue&lt;/i> shows one of Bizet's idiosyncrasies through a listing of the composer's transcriptions of works by others (Gounod, Mozart, Saint-Saëns, et al.).  The primary listing of works gives folio-by-folio detail of manuscripts for longer works with texts of underlying verses and notes on their authors, citations of self-borrowings, and much else.

====Benjamin Britten Thematic Catalogue====

He remained there for the rest of his life.  His numerous works (1,418 church cantatas, 24 secular cantatas, 113 symphonies, 44 solo concertos, 80 suites, miscellaneous chamber music, and eight operas) are largely preserved in the Darmstadt University and (Hessian) State Library. Links on the left lead to manuscript reproductions, those on the right to commercial recordings and editions. Florian Hayerick directs the project.

====Emblematica Online====

Website: [http://emblematica.grainger.illinois.edu/ Emblematica Online]

This umbrella project serves a growing number of library-based projects, which are here cited individually.  Emblem books are rich resources for those interested in decoding visual information in early printed materials.  The collective site currently (April 2014) lists 636 emblem books.  Searches by title, text, and image are supported.  There are two component parts.  (1) 
The [http://emblematica.grainger.illinois.edu/Browse/Books/DigitizedBooksByTitle?instit=Emblematica%20Online Herzog August Bibliothek (HAB) Emblem Books] and (2) the [http://emblematica.grainger.illinois.edu/Browse/Books/DigitizedBooksByTitle?instit=Emblem%20Book University of Illinois Emblem Books].  

The first makes available 636 emblems books, principally from the 17th and 18th centuries. It represents only a tiny fraction of the rich holdings of the [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herzog_August_Bibliothek Herzog August Bibliothek] in Wolffenbüttel, which is particularly rich in seventeenth-century materials.  August the Younger developed a three-tiered description system still in use today.  Two noted figures--[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz G. W. Leibniz] (1691-1716) and  [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing G. E. Lessing] (1770-1781) were later librarians.

One can search by composer, librettist, and so forth.  Since the term &lt;i>libretto&lt;/i> referred to any small book, texts for oratorios, cantatas, serenatas, ballets, and so forth occur in some of the constituent collections.

====Index to Opera and Ballet Sources Online====
