Charles Cronin's Music Copyright Infringement Resource, hosted by the Grould School of Law at the University of Southern California, enables anyone interested in music plagiarism and the grounds on which infringement cases are argued, to review arguments, decisions, and supporting media (page snippets and corresponding MIDI files). Cases from 1844 to the present are reviewed.
